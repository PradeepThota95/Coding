In this problem, we need to determine the ID of last prisoner which can be done by moving M-1 steps further from S.
ID of last prisoner= (M-1+S)
Since we are moving in a circle so we need to take mod of this summation with N.
Because the ID starts from 1, so the ID of last prisoner= (M - 1 + S - 1) % N + 1)
